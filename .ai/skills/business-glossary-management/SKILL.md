# Business Glossary Management

## Outcome
Maintain a consistent, traceable business vocabulary by adding, updating, and consolidating business glossary entries across project documentation and backlog.

## When To Use
- Add a new business term to the glossary
- Update an existing business definition after requirement or domain changes
- Align business wording between requirements, domain model, architecture, specs, and backlog
- Remove ambiguity between related terms
- Detect and resolve duplicate or conflicting definitions

Do not use this skill for technical/acronym glossary maintenance unrelated to business domain language.

## Canonical Glossary Target In This Project
- Canonical business glossary: `docs/domainModel/business-glossary.md`

Secondary references may exist in other docs, but new business glossary entries must be created via this skill and anchored in the canonical glossary.

## Procedure
1. Identify intent and scope.
- Determine whether the request is: `add`, `update`, `merge`, or `rename`.
- Capture the target term, preferred wording, and impacted domain context.

2. Baseline search.
- Search the workspace for existing uses of the term, aliases, abbreviations, and near-synonyms.
- Include requirement IDs and business object names when relevant.

3. Choose action branch.
- `add`: Insert the term in the canonical business glossary.
- `update`: Replace definition text while preserving term identity.
- `merge`: Keep one preferred term; mark or rewrite legacy aliases.
- `rename`: Rename the term and update all references.

4. Edit glossary entries.
- Keep definitions short, explicit, and non-circular.
- Prefer one-sentence definitions plus one context clause when needed.
- Defintion do not include business rules, only the meaning of the term. 
- Keep formatting aligned with each target file style (bullet list vs markdown table).

5. Propagate reference updates.
- Update impacted docs where the old wording appears, especially:
  - `docs/requirements/`
  - `docs/domainModel/`
  - `docs/architecture/`
  - `docs/specs/`
  - `backlog/`
- Do not update skills or agent example files under `.ai/` or `.github/skills/` unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve requirement IDs and avoid changing intent while updating terminology.

6. Consistency checks.
- Ensure no contradictory definitions remain.
- Ensure capitalization and acronym expansion are consistent.
- Ensure renamed terms still keep traceability from old wording.

7. Completion checks.
- The glossary term exists in the canonical business glossary.
- References in impacted documents are updated.
- No stale conflicting term variants remain in active docs.
- The final wording reflects the domain model and requirement intent.

## Decision Rules
- If the same term has different meanings by context, split into distinct terms with qualifiers.
- If two terms are true synonyms, keep one preferred canonical label and alias the other.
- If the request would change business intent, stop and propose requirement/domain updates first.
- If no glossary entry exists and term is already used in requirements, create the entry before further edits.
- New glossary additions must be performed through this skill workflow (no ad-hoc manual insertion outside this process).

## Quality Bar
- Definitions are precise, testable in usage, and easy for non-technical users.
- Avoid implementation details in glossary text.
- Avoid vague wording like "etc.", "and so on", or "generally".
- Keep term naming stable unless a rename is explicitly requested.

## Output Template
Use this summary after updates:
- Action: add/update/merge/rename
- Canonical term: <term>
- Updated files: <list>
- Cross-reference updates: <list>
- Residual risks: <if any>
